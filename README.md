# Summary

This curriculum designs a comprehensive, self-paced program equivalent to a 4-year undergraduate sociology degree, condensed into 1–2 years at approximately 20 hours per week.

It assumes a dedicated learner with no prior background, emphasizing logical progression, prerequisites, and balance between theoretical foundations, empirical methods, and applied synthesis.

Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md) or [extras/other_curricula](extras/other_curricula.md).
