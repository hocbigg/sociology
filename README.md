# Summary

This curriculum designs a comprehensive, self-paced program equivalent to a 4-year undergraduate sociology degree, condensed into 1–2 years at approximately 20 hours per week.

It assumes a dedicated learner with no prior background, emphasizing logical progression, prerequisites, and balance between theoretical foundations, empirical methods, and applied synthesis.

Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md) or [extras/other_curricula](extras/other_curricula.md).

## Organization

The structure is divided into phases: 

1. Intro (fundamentals and orientation)
2. Core (essential subjects mirroring the first three years)
3. Advanced (elective specializations for depth)
4. Capstone (culminating application).

In the Advanced phase, choose 1–2 tracks for focus (e.g., 3–4 subjects per track). Tracks include: 

- Social Inequality and Justice (focus on power dynamics and equity)
- Cultural and Media Sociology (exploration of symbols, identity, and communication)
- Global and Development Sociology (international perspectives on change and inequality)
- Environmental and Urban Sociology (human-environment interactions and city life)
- Health and Medical Sociology (social factors in well-being and healthcare)

**Duration**. **1–2 years** at **~20 hours/week**, depending on pace and experience with research and writing.

**Process**. Students can work through the curriculum alone or in groups, in order or out of order.

- We recommend doing all courses in **Core**, only skipping a course when you are certain that you've already learned the material previously.
- For simplicity, we recommend working through courses (especially Core) in order from top to bottom. Some students choose to study multiple courses at a time in order to vary the material they are working on in a day/week.
- The courses in the Advanced section are electives. Choose one track to specialize in and complete all the courses listed under it.
