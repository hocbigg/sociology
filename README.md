# Summary

The Sociology curriculum is a comprehensive education in Sociology, designed for self-directed study using online materials.

Note: High-quality courses or books that do not fit into the core curriculum are listed separately in
[extras/courses](extras/courses.md) and [extras/readings](extras/readings.md).

## Organization

This repository is organized into three main components:

- **Core Curriculum** (this page): the foundational knowledge of the field;
- **[Advanced Topics](advanced_topics.md)**: focused study in specific areas;
- **[Projects](projects.md)**: support learning through practical application throughout the curriculum.

## Process

Learners may work through the curriculum independently or collaboratively, and either sequentially or selectively.

- For simplicity, courses in the Core Curriculum are ordered according to their prerequisites.
- The Core Curriculum provides a shared foundation and is intended to be completed in full.
- Advanced Topics are optional; learners are encouraged to select one area of focus and complete all courses within that topic.

Practical work is integrated through the [Projects section](projects.md) and may be undertaken alongside coursework.
