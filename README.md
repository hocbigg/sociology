Path to a free self-taught education in Sociology

# Summary

This program is a full, university-level sociology major built from MIT OpenCourseWare, edX, Coursera, HarvardX, Stanford Online, and authoritative textbooks when no suitable open course exists. It mirrors the depth and sequencing of a 4-year undergraduate major—minus general-education coursework—compressed into a feasible 1–2-year track at ~20 hours per week.

Its aim is to help you understand how societies work: social structures, institutions, inequality, culture, identity, power, methods, theory, and the scientific study of social life. You’ll learn classical and contemporary theory, statistical and qualitative methods, research design, and a wide range of substantive areas from race and gender to political economy and globalization. The whole route builds toward a research-ready capstone.

## Organization

• **Intro Sociology**: Orientation, fundamentals of the discipline, and academic habits.
• **Core Sociology**: Roughly the first three years of major coursework: methods, statistics, classical and contemporary theory, major subfields.
• **Advanced Sociology**: Final-year style electives. Choose one specialization track.
• **Final Project**: A capstone research project demonstrating methodological competence and theoretical grounding.

## Duration

**1–2 years** at **~20 hours/week**, divided into sequenced phases.

# 1. Program Overview

## Learning goals and competencies

You will be able to:
• Explain foundational sociological theories (Marx, Durkheim, Weber; structuralism; symbolic interactionism; rational choice; intersectionality; postcolonial theory).
• Apply qualitative and quantitative research methods.
• Design, conduct, analyze, and communicate original sociological research.
• Understand major subfields: inequality, institutions, race/ethnicity, gender, social networks, organizations, culture, deviance, political sociology.
• Evaluate empirical research critically, detect methodological flaws, and place findings in theoretical context.
• Write rigorous academic essays, literature reviews, and research proposals.

## Skills map

**Theory**: classical thinkers, contemporary schools, social change, power, culture.
**Methods**: research design, statistics, intro data analysis (R or Python), interviewing, ethnography, comparative methods.
**Tools**: basic statistical programming, bibliographic management, qualitative note-coding workflow.
**Practice**: case studies, mini-fieldwork, data analysis projects, literature reviews, capstone thesis.

• Textbook: *Massey, Categorically Unequal* (paid; excellent).

### Track B: Political Economy & Development

• [Political Economy of Institutions and Development (MIT OCW)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/17-42-causes-and-prevention-of-war-spring-2009/)

# Final Project (Capstone)

### Goal

Design and execute an **independent research project** demonstrating theoretical framing, methodological rigor, and clear analysis.

### Process

1. **Proposal (3–5 pages)**: research question, literature review, theory, method.
2. **Midterm checkpoint**: data collection or corpus assembly; preliminary analysis.
3. **Final deliverable (15–25 pages)**: fully argued paper with figures/tables; reproducible code appendix (if quantitative).
4. **Peer review**: exchange with peers via forums or research communities.
5. **Public sharing**: GitHub repo (quant); PDF with appendices (qual).

### Evaluation rubric

• **Theoretical grounding**: clarity and correctness of concepts.
• **Methodological rigor**: appropriate design, data integrity, analytic reasoning.
• **Originality**: insight, creativity, contribution.
• **Clarity**: structure, writing, logic.
• **Reproducibility** (if quantitative): code + data.

# 3. Alternatives and Resilience

### Backups for major courses

• Intro: *Coursera – Social Science Approaches to the Study of Chinese Society*.
• Quantitative methods: *Coursera – Methods and Statistics in Social Sciences Specialization (Amsterdam)* (audit free).
• Theory: Yale OCW sociology lectures (video, not full course).
• Race/gender: edX – “U.S. Public Policy: Social, Economic, and Foreign Policies” for inequality context.

### Catch-up modules

• **Math for Social Scientists**: *Khan Academy – Statistics & Probability* (free).
• **Academic writing**: *edX – English Grammar and Style (UQx)*.
• **Research design basics**: Trochim’s *Research Methods Knowledge Base* (free).

### Free auditing

• edX: “Audit this course” = full content access.
• Coursera: “Audit only” mode available on most courses.
• MIT OCW: Fully free.

---

# 4. Study Process and Checkpoints

A weekly routine for ~20 hours:
• ~6 hrs lectures
• ~6 hrs readings
• ~4 hrs notes + reflection
• ~4 hrs assignments (mini-essays, data exercises)

Every **8–12 weeks**, complete:
• One short analytic essay (1,000–1,500 words).
• One methods checkpoint (mini-dataset analysis OR short interview/ethnography fieldnote).
• One portfolio artifact: literature review, annotated bibliography, or coding notebook.

Portfolio examples:
• Ethnographic fieldnotes (2–3 observations).
• Quant notebook: regression, visualization, RMarkdown.
• Sociological essay on theory application.
• Annotated bibliography of 20+ papers for capstone.

---

# 5. Specialization Tracks

All four listed above (Inequality; Political Economy; Culture/Identity/Media; Organizations/Networks) are selectable. Completing 2–3 courses in your track = concentration.
