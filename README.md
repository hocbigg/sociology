# Summary

The Sociology curriculum is a **complete education in Sociology** using online materials.

This curriculum offers a comprehensive, self-paced, globally accessible sociology education equivalent to a 4-year undergraduate major (minus general-education courses). It uses high-quality open courses from MIT OCW, edX, Coursera, Harvard Open Learning, Open Yale Courses, Stanford Online, and authoritative textbooks where necessary.

The program emphasizes theory, research methods, data analysis, and substantive domains of sociological inquiry. It is designed for independent learners developing strong academic habits, critical reasoning, and the ability to interpret and conduct sociological research.

Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md) or [extras/other_curricula](extras/other_curricula.md).

## Organization

* **Intro Sociology**: Orientation, foundational knowledge, and basic academic habits.
* **Core Sociology**: Canonical theories, research methods, statistics, and major subfields.
* **Advanced Sociology**: Elective specializations to build expertise.
* **Final Project**: A capstone research project suitable for sharing, peer review, or portfolio inclusion.

**Duration**. **1–2 years** at **~20 hours/week**, depending on pace and experience with research and writing.

**Process**. Students can work through the curriculum alone or in groups, in order or out of order.

- We recommend doing all courses in **Core**, only skipping a course when you are certain that you've already learned the material previously.
- For simplicity, we recommend working through courses (especially Core) in order from top to bottom. Some students choose to study multiple courses at a time in order to vary the material they are working on in a day/week.
- The courses in the Advanced section are electives. Choose one track to specialize in and complete all the courses listed under it.
